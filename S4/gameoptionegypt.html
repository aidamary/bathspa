        There are more than 130,000 Syrian refugees in Egypt. It's not a stable country and jobs are scarce.
        <br>
        Since 2013, Egypt has not allowed any more Syrians into the country without a visa.
        But your family gets lucky and is granted visas.
        <br>
        You've been in Cairo a week when you meet Ahmad, the smuggler. Ahmad says he can help you. 
        <br>
        You're not sure if you can trust him, but you know you have to take risks on this journeyâ€¦
        <br>
        Ahmad explains that you have two options:
        to travel to Italy from Alexandria by sea or you can go to Libya, where the sea crossing is shorter.
    </p>
    <h4>You have to choose</h4>
    <a href="optionlibya.html"></a><button>Libya - It's a shorter sea crossing from Benghazi.
        There are militia groups on the way and the route can be dangerous.</button></a><br>
        <br>
    <a href="optionalexandria.html"></a><button>Alexandria - It's a much longer journey by sea.
        There is a higher chance of getting caught and deported.</button></a>
