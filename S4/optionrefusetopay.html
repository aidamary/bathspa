    <h2>Refuse To Pay</h2>
    <br>
    <p>You don't pay Abu Hassan the deposit because you don't trust him.
        <br>
        You decide to involve a well-known middleman, who has an established office in Istanbul.
        <br>
        Abu Hassan agrees to take the money from the middleman after you arrive in Greece.
        <br>
        You now have a choice: you can pay $7,500 per person and travel by land via Edirne.
        <br>
        Or pay $5,000 per person and go by sea via Izmir.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>You have to choose</h4>
    <a href="optionbysea.html"><button>Sea - Travelling by sea is very risky, boats capsize all the time.
        But there is less chance of getting caught.</button></a><br>
    <br>
    <a href="optionbyland.html"><button>Land - Travelling by land may be less risky, there are many routes.
        But you're more likely to get caught.</button> </a>
